# Tranquilli-Final
For my final project, I decided to create a small portfolio page highlighting my work done at my NYLON Magazine internship. 
The works included display email blasts that I created to be sent out every Monday and Thursday to NYLON Magazine subscribers. 

During the project, I encountered some minor problems when trying to work Jquery. Specifically, I had to rework my project multiple times
due to syntax errors. I wanted to highlight the NYLON logo displayed on the top portion of the page so I included the yellow dropshadow.
The paragraph tags on the page load in chronological order, with hovering over the logo starting the reaction. This creates a unique user
interaction for the page.
