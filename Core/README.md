This project is based off of my familie's history, as I am half Polish and half Italian. At the begining of the questionaire, users are asked to choose between being Italian or Polish. When users click on the polish flag, they are confronted with text in Polish that only offers them one link to click on. I made this portion of the questionaire a dead end because I'm not very close with my Polish side.

Players are confronted with the option of becoming either an artist or a doctor. In the event that they choose artist, the notice right away that it is a dead end. This represents they beliefs about becoming an artist in my Italian side of my family. Players who chose doctor will notices that they are congradulated and praised based on the amount of money they are going to earn. While apprehensive, the player continues on as a doctor, even though they wish to be an artist. 

At the end of the game, players are confronted with the decission to continue on as a doctor or follow their dream of being an artist. If the player decides to continue as a doctor, they eventually die feeling unfulfilled. If they decide to follow their dream of becoming an artist, they lead a happy and successful life, despite their familie's aversion. 

This game is meant to represeant the disdian that myself and many other people persuing a creative field face. I thought it would be interesting to manifest my extended families disapproval as a game, as I sometimes feel like I was playing one with them.
