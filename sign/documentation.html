        <div class="description">For this project, I decided to work with the Cloisters museum, as it is one of my favorite museums in all of New York City. The museum, which specializes in displaying medieval art, is a branch of the MET that is surrounded by a park in Washington heights. This makes the museum a lot more secluded and provides it with less foot traffic than other branches of the MET. This helped in deciding to create a sign that represented this museum.<br>

Specifically, I chose to create a sign to promote some of the most famous works at the museum; the Unicorn Tapestries. The tapestries, which stand at 144 7/8 x 99 in, depict a medieval village hunt for the elusive unicorn. The seven tapestries detail the hunt, attack, capture, and eventual killing of the unicorn. However, while the undertone and meaning of the tapestries is particularly grim, the represent the beauty and art of the tapestry from medieval Europe. <br>
            <br>

When creating my project, I wanted to approach the style of the webpage in a way that was not too stylized and cliche. Specifically, I kept the nature of the museum and subject matter alive in my title, but used an non-styled serif font in the body of my project. Much like the tapestries themselves, I created a web sign that reads almost like a fairytale would. Users are presented, much like the pages of a book, a brief description of each tapestry. I highlighted keywords in each passage to help guide users throughout the webpage. Upon hovering over these flashing words, the text body disappears and only leaves the flashing words. Then, the description for the next tapestry appears, leaving all the preceding keywords behind. This helps highlight the gruesome undertone of the tapestries, as most of the words are grim and violent. <br><br>

            At the end of my project, users hover over the word "castle". This takes them to the final portion of the page, which displays the address and a photo of the cloisters museum. </div>
