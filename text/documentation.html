    “Text” Project Description
<p>When trying to decide on two texts to merge to create alternative meaning for the “Text” project, I began thinking about text that change meaning if the viewer was missing a portion of its meaning. With this in mind, I eventually got the idea to create a website that utilized the descriptions associated with horoscopes and zodiac signs to create alternative meaning. 
	In the back of my mind, I’ve always had fond memories of visiting the store “Love Saves The Day” in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Specifically, I always remember the “Human Analysis” fortune-telling machine they had on display in the front of the store. The machine is supposed to provide users with a glimpse of what the future may hold for them, as long as the pay the quarter to use the machine. However, the best part of the machine is that there are maybe 5 different variations of answers users can get. If you’re with a larger group of people, the odds you yourself and someone else in the group getting the same reading are very high. Overall, it was the repetitiveness of the machine that inspired my interactive text game.</p>
	At my designs core, the user is interacting with the voice of the “Human Analysis” machine. Much like the machine in the store, the “machine” in my game insists that it processes magical powers that are correct 100% of the time. The repetitive components of the game come to life in the fact that, no matter what the user answers, they will always get the same results. Specifically, I decided to use Aries, as there are the least amount of births in April. This helps reduce the likelihood of the machine being correct.<p>
	Upon completing the questionnaire portion of the game, the Analysis machine presents viewers with the results. When presented with “Aries” users are asked to select whether or not the computer was correct by clicking the “right” or “wrong” button. Again, repetition is used in both scenarios. If users click “right”, the machine presents them with a screen that states that the computer made an error in calculation and presented the wrong information to the user. This compels the user to play again and ultimately run encounter the same problem.</p>
	If the user tells the computer that the results were incorrect, the computer insists on its abilities to provide an accurate analysis. With this, the computer presents the user with one option: replay the game. Just like if the viewer has selected “correct”, they are compelled to play the game again.<p>
	The design of the game derives from the novelty nature of the actual human analysis machine. The machine presents itself in a way that utilizes generic approaches to creating a “magical” aesthetic. The galaxy background on the game further helps promote the kitsch approach of the game.</p>
	<p>My design combines texts from generic horoscope/astrology quizzes that I discovered in Marie Clare and excerpts from astorology.com. After users are asked the seemingly simple question, the computer presents them with an in-depth description the Aries that far exceeds the complexity of the text. In doing so, my game combines two very extreme representations of astrology in our culture. </p>
