        <div class="hey">The seven individual hangings collectively known as The Unicorn Tapestries are among the most beautiful and complex works of art from the late Middle Ages that survive. Luxuriously woven in fine wool and silk with silver and gilded threads, the tapestries vividly depict scenes associated with a</div><div class="bold">hunt</div> 
        <div class="hey2"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp for the elusive, magical unicorn. Depicted in the seven scenes is the hunt and eventual capture of the elusive unicorn.</div>
        
        <div class="hey3">Hunters begin their quest in the tapestry titled "Hunters Enter the Woods." It was widely believed In the Middle Ages the Unicorn was best known for its supposed invincibility and for the therapeutic property of its horn. So strong was the belief in the horn's miraculous cures that by the twelfth century the tusks of male narwhals, a small whale native to the Arctic, came to be regarded as "unicorn horns."</div>
        
        <div class="hey4">In the tapestry "The Unicorn Is Found", hunters stumble upon the Unicorn resting by a river bed. 12 hunters gather around to discuss their discovery and how they are going to &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  the creature. </div>
        <div class="attack">Attack</div>
        <div class="hey5">According to tradition, the unicorn cannot be disturbed while performing a magical act. The attack by the hunters thus presumably begins soon after the action depicted in The Unicorn Is Found, and the scene is one filled with chaos and commotion. The dogs surround the unicorn as the hunters ready their spears in the scene "The Unicorn Is Attacked". The unicorn, caught by surprise, is startled by the commotion of the group. </div>
