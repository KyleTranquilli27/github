    <h1>Marilyn Monroe: Her Influence on Pop Culture</h1>
    <body class="text">
       <p>As one of the world's most recognizable actresses, Marilyn Monroe’s many signature styles, mannerisms, and habits have been adopted stars succeeding her who hope to find the same success. For my screensaver project, I decided to create a screensaver that animates Monroe’s most signature attributes, and apply it to all of her copycats. Her signature winks and blinks seemed most appropriate, as they are the most notable of her contrived, doll-like characteristics on screen. 
	As an actress and a business woman, Marilyn Monroe knew just how important marketing and appearances were. Specifically, she was cognizant of the desires of men and how she could manipulate her appearance to captivate their attention. Before adopting her signature stage name of Marilyn Monroe, she was a known as Norma Jeane Baker, a small town girl who lived in various orphanages throughout her childhood. Upon arriving in Hollywood, Monroe dyed her hair blonde and even went as far as to have a chin implant and nose job to perfect her “dumb blonde” persona.<br>
    <div class="madonna"></div>
	At the beginning of my screensaver, I show Marilyn in one of her most recognized photographs. Her signature wink is incorporated and copied by the various performers coming after her in the screensaver. After this first image, Madonna appears about 12 seconds into the screensaver. In this particular image, Madonna, who has drawn inspiration and copied much of Marilyn’s work, is depicted in the same signature hairstyle, makeup, and expression as Monroe. <br>
    <div class="anna"></div>
	After Madonna, I presented another image of Monroe, this time from her film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. In this particular image, Marilyn is shown during her performance of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend.” Right after, an image of Madonna appears again. This time, she is shown performing her 80’s hit “Material Girl”, using the same setting, costume, and themes as Marilyn. If you watch the actual “Material Girl” video, Madonna makes the same fluid, gentle like movements Marilyn makes in most of her films.
	After Madonna, an image of Anna Nicole Smith appears. Anna Nicole Smith, like Madonna, drew much of her inspiration, image, and personality traits from Marilyn. However, Anna Nicole Smith credits Madonna as a big source of inspiration for herself alongside Marilyn. By having Anna Nicole appear after Madonna, I show the progression of Marilyn’s influence on pop culture. When Madonna became inspired by Marilyn, and Anna Nicole became inspired by Madonna, Marilyn’s influence on pop culture continues to cycle from decade to decade.<br>
	Through personal research, I found that much of the influences of Marilyn in today’s pop culture go unnoticed by consumers, as they believe some of her trademarks and characteristics were first introduced by someone like Madonna. For example, when asking my roommates and friends to review my project, almost all of them had originally thought that it was Madonna who had created the aesthetic derived from “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend.” In reality, Madonna was simply referencing the work of Marilyn. This shows that even though some in today’s generation can’t quite pinpoint or reference specific Marilyn Monroe qualities and references, her influence is profound. Moreover, it shows the effects of appropriation, as the original artist has lost credit to the replica version of their work.<br>
	To further explain this effect, I incorporated images of Gwen Stefani. Her look, which is classic Marilyn Monroe, is used to sell her music in the same way that Madonna and Marilyn sold themselves. However, I found it particularly interesting that Gwen Stefani credits Madonna as an influence on her career and not as much Marilyn. This shows that, despite Madonna’s obvious reference to Marilyn, sometimes people credit her with the creation of the “Blonde Bombshell” aesthetic.<br>
	At the end of my screensaver, Marilyn is once again depicted. This time, she is shown in an all black setting to represent the timeless nature of her style and grace. She sits as a “placeholder” for future Marilyn references to come. In my project , I purposely represented a Marilyn reference from each decade, starting with Madonna in the 80’s and up to Gwen Stefani in the early 2000’s. I plan to add to this project in the future, as there has yet to be a star in pop culture in our current decade that adopts Marilyn’s work as her own.
